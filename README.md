* Data were collected at 8 different sites to collect and deploy instruments that monitor temperature, current, pH, light, bioerosion and calcification.

* At the Est Buoy 3, landscape mosaics(n=6) and carbonate budget surveys(n=6) were completed to monitor changes in benthic cover and carbonate production.
