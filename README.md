* The most recent climate monitoring took place at Dry Tortugas National park from June 24th to June 29th 2021.

* Data were collected at 4 different sites to collect and deploy instruments that monitor temperature, current, pH, light, bioerosion and calcification.

* At the Bird Key Reef site, landscape mosaics(n=6) and carbonate budget surveys(n=6) were completed to monitor changes in benthic cover and carbonate production.
